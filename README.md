# TrendSpire

TrendSpire gathers trending repositories from GitHub and stores them in `TRENDING.md`. GitHub Actions keep the digest fresh and leverage OpenAI Codex to continuously improve the codebase.

## Features

- Automated scraping of GitHub's trending page with configurable language, time range and result limit.
- Daily workflow to regenerate `TRENDING.md` and update this README.
- Scheduled Codex runs that suggest small refactors and new tests via pull requests.
- Token and cost tracking for all Codex requests.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the setup wizard**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_wizard.py
   ```
   This interactive script stores your preferred trending options and OpenAI API key.
   You can rerun it at any time to change the configuration.

3. **Run the trending scraper**
   ```bash
   python -m src.render_digest
   ```
   The latest results will appear in `TRENDING.md` and the README.

4. **Run the self-improvement loop**
   With your virtual environment active run:
   ```bash
   python trendspire_autoloop.py --mode daily
   ```
   Replace `daily` with `weekly` for a full project review. The script will apply the AI's diff, run the tests and open a pull request when successful.

## GitHub Actions

### Update Digest

The workflow [`update_digest.yml`](.github/workflows/update_digest.yml) runs every day at 08:00 UTC. It installs the dependencies, executes `python -m src.render_digest`, and commits any changes to `TRENDING.md` and `README.md`.

### Codex Automation

Another workflow [`auto_codex_mixed.yml`](.github/workflows/auto_codex_mixed.yml) drives the Codex automation using [`trendspire_autoloop.py`](trendspire_autoloop.py). It supports two modes:

- **Daily** – diff-based improvements using `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- **Weekly** – a full repository review with `gpt-4o`.

Each run applies the returned diff, executes the test suite and, when successful, creates a branch and pull request. Summaries, cost logs and the raw diff are saved under `codex_logs/` and uploaded as workflow artifacts.

To run the Codex automation locally you can execute:

```bash
python trendspire_autoloop.py --mode daily   # or weekly
```

### API usage reports

The file `logs/api_usage.csv` records model token counts and cost. Use `python scripts/summarize_usage.py` for a quick summary grouped by model.
