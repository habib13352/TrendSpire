 ### API usage reports
+
+To gain insights into the API usage and understand the token counts and cost associated with using the OpenAI API, you can make use of the `logs/api_usage.*` files. Set the environment variable `API_LOG_FORMAT` to one of the following values to control the format of the logs: `csv`, `json`, or `txt`.
+
+You can run the following command to get a quick summary, which groups the usage by model:
+
+```bash
+python scripts/summarize_usage.py
+```
+
+Monitoring your API usage can help manage costs and optimize model choices.
+
 The file `logs/api_usage.*` records token counts and cost. Set `API_LOG_FORMAT`
 to `csv`, `json` or `txt` to control the format. Run `python
 scripts/summarize_usage.py` for a quick summary grouped by model.
