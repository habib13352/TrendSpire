 ### Codex Automation
 
 Another workflow [`ai_loop.yml`](.github/workflows/ai_loop.yml) drives the Codex automation using [`ai_loop/autoloop.py`](ai_loop/autoloop.py). It supports two modes:
 
-- **Daily** ‚Äì diff-based improvements using `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
+- **Daily** ‚Äì diff-based improvements using `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`.
 - **Weekly** ‚Äì a full repository review with `gpt-4o`.
 
 Each run applies the returned diff, executes the test suite and, when successful, creates a branch and pull request. Summaries, cost logs and the raw diff are saved under `codex_logs/` and uploaded as workflow artifacts. The workflow also caches the `trendspire_memory/` directory so the AI can refine its suggestions over time.
