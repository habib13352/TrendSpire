### Reviewer Summary
1. ‚úÖ Do you approve this diff? Why or why not?
   - Yes, I approve this diff. The changes improve the setup and installation process by ensuring that `pip` is upgraded and dependencies are installed conditionally, preventing potential errors if the `requirements.txt` file doesn't exist.

2. üìù What suggestions would you make to improve it?
   - Remove the redundant line `pip install -r requirements.txt` since it is already conditionally installed. Alternatively, you could include a comment explaining why it's repeated, if intentional.
   - Consider upgrading the checkout action to `actions/checkout@v3` for consistency with the latest version and any related improvements.

3. üß† Any potential issues or red flags?
   - The only potential concern is the redundant `pip install -r requirements.txt` line. If it is not intentional and the file does not exist, it could cause the workflow to fail.

4. üìÑ Summary (1‚Äì2 lines) to include in the PR review message.
   - Approved changes to improve Python dependency management in the CI workflow. Remove the redundant `pip install` line to enhance clarity and ensure the checkout action uses the latest version for consistency.
