# Phase 2 Wrap-Up

This report confirms the completion of Phase 2 of TrendSpire's AI loop.

## Phase 2.1 – Agent Pipeline
- Introduced **Planner**, **Coder** and **PR Agent** modules.
- Linked them together via `agent_loop.py` for a minimal end-to-end run.

## Phase 2.2 – Memory & Logging
- `context_builder` now collects README excerpts, goal text and the latest trending snapshot.
- A short memory log from `trendspire_memory/memory.txt` is included when present.
- The GitHub workflow runs this step and uploads `codex_logs/` and `trendspire_memory/` as artifacts.

## Agent Wiring
- `agent_loop.run()` passes the full context through Planner → Coder → PR Agent.
- Agents read the memory excerpt to provide continuity between runs.
- Missing memory triggers a warning but does not stop execution.

## Cleanup & Structure
- Sample logs moved to `codex_logs/archive/` and memory samples to `trendspire_memory/samples/`.
- `.gitignore` now excludes generated logs and memory files.
- Basic validation messages ensure goals, repo summary and trend data are present when building context.

## Recommendation
✅ Ready for Phase 3
